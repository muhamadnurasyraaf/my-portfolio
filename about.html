    <section class="story">

        <p>Allow me to share a brief summary of my programming journey. I have been coding for approximately six to seven years, starting when I was around 13 years old. Although this might sound unbelievable to you as you read this, let me provide an explanation.
         During that time, I was studying at SMAR (Sekolah Menengah Agama Rompin) and residing in a hostel, which made it impractical for me to dedicate a significant amount of time to coding since I couldn't bring my own laptop. 
         Consequently, my programming studies were inconsistent. Nevertheless, I persisted in learning what I could, focusing on improving my understanding of basic algorithms.
        You may be wondering why I decided to learn coding.</p>
        <p>
            It all began when I encountered numerous game development journey videos on YouTube, which served as a great source of motivation. I became passionate about game development.
            However, the steep learning curve and the resource-intensive nature of rendering 3D models discouraged me, as my laptop was only suitable for basic office tasks and struggled with lag even during light usage by my father. 
            As a result, I shifted my focus solely to programming. During my second semester pursuing a diploma, I delved into object-oriented programming, which significantly transformed my coding practices. 
            Exploring the world of object-oriented programming was incredibly enjoyable and enhanced the cleanliness of my code.

        <p>
            This positive experience prompted me to venture into web development. Within a month, I managed to learn HTML and CSS, allowing me to build a YouTube clone (frontend only).
            However, this task presented a challenging opportunity for me to test my abilities in independently creating a functional website. Currently, my primary programming language is PHP, as I find backend development more engaging than frontend design.
            I thoroughly enjoy working with logic and problem-solving aspects rather than focusing on website aesthetics.
